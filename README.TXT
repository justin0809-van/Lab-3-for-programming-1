This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.


Question 1) The difference between a Class diagram and an object diagram is that, theres
arrows exiting out of a diagram(Thats a class diagram) and the arrows pointing towards a
diagram is an Object diagram.

Question 2) You can change it by creating new classes or changing the relationship.

Question 3) Change the objects by Changing it or deleting it. For example, the student class
can be changed by enrolling it.

Question 4) private instructorTutor;

Question 5) Each time i do the increment method, hours.increment(); shows up. The value goes up by 1 everytime i increment and it resets to 1 each time
i reach the value of 24.

Question 6) For the mintue  object, it shows minutes.increment();
Everytime the value for mintues rolls over, we increment value on the object "Hours". Because 60 minutes = 1 hour has passed.   

Question 7) I typed in the commands for this one and everytime i entered the increment command in the pad, the value increases by 1 i n the terminal window.

Question 8) First command worked, thats because it was below the display limit:6.  The second command didnt work because it went over the limit
so it rolled over and went back to zero. If i wish to get the number 10, i'll have to put higher display number.

Question 9) I predicted the answer and it's 0.

Question 10) Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context

Question 11) Error code i receive is display.setValue(int 5);
             The correct method is display.setValue(5);
             
Question 12) After replacing it, it doesnt roll over when it hits 10 anymore. So <= means it wont rollover if the value
is equivalent or higher than 10.

Question 13)0

Question 14)You can now set negative values as long as they are greater or equal than the value.

Question 15) - ! false
             - (34 != 33) && ! false
             
Question 16) (a && b)

Question 17) (a! && b) or (a && b!)

Question 18) its 0.

Question 19) No, both returns the same string.

Question 20) Yes it did. its because, when a string comes after numbers, the numbers gets added.
if the string comes before numbers, then it becomes a whole string.
